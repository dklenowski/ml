## Notes ##

> "Living organisms can be viewed as a duality of their genotype (the underlying 
> genetic code) and their phenotype (the manner of response contained in the 
> behaviour, physiology and morphology of the organism)."

> "The mapping between the genotype and the phenotype is characterised by 
> pleiotropy and polygeny.
> Pleiotropy is the effect that a single gene may simultaneously affect 
> several phenotypic traits.
> Polygeny is the effect that a single phenotypic characteristic of an individual
> may be determined by the simultaneous interaction of many genes".

> "It is therefore not reasonable to expect that the function (i.e. phenotypic 
> effect) of a given genetic operator as it occurs in nature can be easily replicated in 
> a simulation simply by including an idealised version of the operator.
> In a simulation, both the genetic information at hand and the environment
> with which the genotype interacts to generate a phenotype are 
> qualitatively different (e.g. orders of magnitude less complex) from 
> their natural analogues."

> "This reveals an inherent limitation of genetic algorithms. 
> As bottom-up reductionist models of evolution they are not broadly useful 
> for making predictions about natural evolution."

> "By overemphasising low-level operators and components, the fundamental
> effect of selection on behaviours in evolutionary processes is lost."

> "But top-down models that emphasise individual and species behaviour
> (e.g. evolution strategies and evolution programming) and the adaption and diversity
> of that behaviour in light of selection, offer the possibility for making reasonable 
> predictions of the pattens of phenotypes in response to selective pressures,
> regardless of the genetic mechanism involved in the natural process"
