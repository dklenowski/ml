## Six Steps ##

1. Know what the GA is processing: building blocks.
2. Ensure an adequate supply of building blocks either initially or temporarily.
3. Ensure the growth of necessary building blocks.
4. Ensure the mixing of necessary building blocks.
5. Solve problems that are building-block tractable or recode them so they are.
6. Decide well among competing building blocks.
