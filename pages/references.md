# Introduction

## Neural Networks

Patrick Winston from MIT provides an easy to understand introduction to Neural Networks and backpropogation. His course can be found on the MIT Opencourseware Site (http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-034-artificial-intelligence-fall-2010).

His lecture video's are particularly good and his sense of humor is unique for a Computer Scientist !
