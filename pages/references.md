## Getting your head around Neural Networks

There has been an explosion in AI/deep learning/Neural Networks etc over the last couple of years. Having studied (and soon forgot about it) Artifical Intelligence, I thought now might be a good time to get back into it. I was quickly overwhelmed with the sheer volume of information about AI and also the levels of complexity some of the research had reached. 


## Neural Networks

Patrick Winston from MIT provides an easy to understand introduction to Neural Networks and backpropogation. His course can be found on the MIT Opencourseware Site (http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-034-artificial-intelligence-fall-2010).

His lecture video's are particularly good and his sense of humor is unique for a Computer Scientist !
